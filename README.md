# Express.js and Node.js Template with Static Files

This repository serves as a basic template for setting up an Express.js application with Node.js, including handling static files. It's a great starting point for web projects that require a server-side backend.
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

## Project Structure
`index.js`: This is the main entry point of the application where the Express server is configured.


`public/`: This directory is where you can place your static files such as HTML, CSS, images, client-side JavaScript, etc.

## Starting the Server
To start the server using Node.js:
``` bash 
node index.js
```

Or, with nodemon (it automatically restarts the server when changes are made):
```bash
npx nodemon index.js
```
